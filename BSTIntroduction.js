            text: 'A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure that looks much like a physical tree from the natural world. It is structured using objects called nodes. Every node has a key. Every tree starts with a root node, which is the starting point of all operations performed on the tree. The root node (parent) is connected only to two other nodes (children) through links - because of that the tree is called a binary tree. The tree property requires that every child node to the left has a smaller key than the parent and every child node to the right has a bigger key than the parent. Null key indicates that a node doesnâ€™t have an assigned key and has no links (children).\n\nThe Binary Search Tree is a structure that can contain multiple subtrees. The child of every parent is a root of a subtree.This data structure helps to organise data more quickly. Binary search trees are primarily used for searching and sorting operations.',
